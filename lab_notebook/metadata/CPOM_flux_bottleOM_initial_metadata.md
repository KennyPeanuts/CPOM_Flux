## Variables

* CPOM = indication of whether the BOD bottles contained leaf discs ("yes") or not ("no")

* tot.OM = the total amount of OM in the bottle, calculated as the mass of the leaf OM (`leaf.OM`) plus the sediment OM (`sed.OM`) (g)

* leaf.OM = the median leaf OM mass from `CPOM_Flux_Exp_BOD_OM_Analysis.md` multiplied by the number of leaves in the bottles (20) (g).

* sed.OM = the median mass of the OM in the sediments of the BOD bottles from `CPOM_Flux_Exp_BOD_OM_Analysis.md`
