Description:

Compilation of the organic matter data collected at the beginning of the CPOM Flux experiment.  Details on the collection and processing can be found in:

* `LPP_CPOM_Flux_Setup_Part3_29May2014.md` for the "cpom" samples

* `Leaf_OM_Content_Flux_Experiment_30May2014.md` for the "leaf.disc" samples

* `Sediment_Dry_Mass_+AFDM_30 May2014.md` for the "sed" samples

## Variables

* date = the date the samples were collected (YYYY-MM-DD)

* om = the type of organic matter sample: "sed" is pond sediment passed through a 250um sieve, "cpom" is coarse material retained by a 1mm sieve, and "leaf.disc" is a 10mm leaf disc cut from the tulip poplar leaves used in the experiment.

* rep = a replicate sample ID

* bag.mass = the mass of the paper bag used to dry the cpom (g)

* bag.cpom = the mass of the bag and the added cpom after drying at 50 dC (g)

* cruc = the ID number of the crucible used for ashing and drying the organic matter.

* cruc.mass = the mass of the empty crucible (g)

* cruc.wet.sed = the mass of the crucible and the wet sediment (g)

* cruc.dry.sed = the mass of the crucible and the sediment after drying at 50 dC (g)

* cruc.ash = the mass of the crucible and the ash that remained after cooking the sample at 550 dC for 4+ hours (g)
