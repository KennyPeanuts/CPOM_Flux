Description:

The calculated absorbence ratio at 245:365nm for the DOM in the CPOM Flux experiment.

The data come from:

> Helms, J. R. A. Stubbins, J. D. Ritchie, E. C. Minor, D. J. Kieber, K. Mopper. 2008. Absorption spectral slopes and slope ratios as indicators of molecular weight, source, and photobleaching of chromophoric dissolved organic matter. Limnology and Oceanography 53:955-969.

Calculation details and code in `CPOM_Flux_Exp_spec_calc.md` in the `analysis` folder.

**These data should be used for all analyses**

## Variables

* bod = the identifying number of the BOD bottles

* day = the date that the samples were collected from the BOD bottles

* CPOM = whether the bottles contained "yes" or did not contain "no" CPOM

* nutrient = whether the bottles contained "yes" or did not contain "no" added DIN and DIP

* ratio254 = the calculated ratio of the absorbence at 254 and 365nm. See `CPOM_Flux_Exp_spec_calc.md` for calculation code and details.

* elapsed.d = the number of days elapsed during the incubation.
