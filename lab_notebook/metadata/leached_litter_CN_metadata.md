Collected by: KF JA, JM, C/N analysis completed by Matt Waters at Valdosta State

Collected on: Fall 2015 

Affiliation: Longwood University

Location: Longwood University

Description:

The collection of the sediment and leaf discs for %C and %N analysis is described in [leached_litter_breakdown_notes](https://github.com/KennyPeanuts/CPOM_Flux/blob/master/lab_notebook/lab_notes/leached_litter_breakdown_notes.md)

Briefly, 4 leaf discs, a surface sediment core (1 cm X 0.8 cm), and a sediment core (1 cm z X 0.8 cm diam) were collected from each bottle and placed into a 20 ml glass scintillation vial and dried at 50 dC. The samples were then homogenized with a mortar and pestle and sent to the Waters lab at Valdosta State University for C and N analysis.

**These data should be used for all analyses**

## Variables

* Sample = the ID code for the samples sent to Matt. 

* BOD = the identifying number of the BOD bottle from which the sample was taken

* Treat = the treatment level, where L = leaf discs only, S = sediments only, LS = leaf discs and sediments 

* Repeat = indicates whether the sample is a repeat run for QA QC, where N = no and Y = yes.

* Type = the type of organic matter in the sample, where Leaf = leaf disks and Sed = sediments.

* percN = the percent nitrogen content of the sample

* percC = the percent carbon content of the sample

* CN = the ratio of C to N in the sample calculated as C.mass / N.mass
