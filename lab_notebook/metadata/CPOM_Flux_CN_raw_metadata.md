## Metadata

Collected by: KF and KDP, C/N analysis completed by Matt Waters at Valdosta State

Collected on: 3 July 2014

Affiliation: Longwood University

Location: Longwood University

Description:

The collection of the sediment and leaf discs for %C and %N analysis is described in `CPOM_flux_break-down_notes.md` in the `lab_notes` folder.

Briefly, 4 leaf discs, a surface sediment core (1 cm X 0.8 cm), and a bulk sediment core (z cm X 0.8 cm) were collected from each bottle and placed into a 20 ml glass scintillation vial and dried at 50 dC. The samples were then homogenized with a mortar and pestle and sent to the Waters lab at Valdosta State University for C and N analysis.

## Variables

* Source = the type of organic matter that is in the sample. "bulk" is a 0.8 cm diameter core of the entire sediment column, "surf" is a 0.8 cm diameter core from the sediment-water interface down to 1 cm, and "leaf" is 4 leaf discs homogenized together.

* Vial = the identifying number of the BOD bottle from which the sample was taken

* mass = the mass of the dried sample in mg

* percN = the percent nitrogen content of the sample

* percC = the percent carbon content of the sample

### Notes

bulk sample in vial 13 was broken during shipping and so the some of the sample was lost.  The percC and percN values are not likely reliable.

bulk sample vial 1 was broken during shipping and all material was lost.
