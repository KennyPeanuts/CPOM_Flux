These notes describe the process for collecting the OM samples at the end of the Leached Litter Experiment

### Samples Needed

 Sample Type     | Sample Material                          | Number of Samples
 ----------      | --------------                             ----------------
 Leaf Ergosterol | 4 leaf disks in 10 ml Methanol             8 
 Leaf C:N        | 4 leaf disks dried in scint vial           8
 Leaf AFDM       | 12 leaf disks dried in crucible            8
 Surf. Sed Ergo  | 1 X 0.8 cm core in 10 ml Methanol          12
 Surf. Sed AFDM  | 1 X 0.8 cm core dried in scint vial        12
 Surf. Sed C:N   | 1 X 0.8 cm core dried in crucible          12
 Bulk Sed C:N    | z X 0.8 cm core dried in a scint vial      12

### Procedure

1) Drain off water with a siphon without disturbing the sediment water interface

2) Using a plastic pipette with the tip cut off (0.8 cm diameter) and a manual pipetter, we removed 3, 1 cm deep core samples from center of bottle and deposited each into:

    * 10 ml of methanol in a 20 ml glass scintillation vial for Ergosterol, 
    
    * a 20 ml glass scintillation vial to be dried at 50 dC for %C and %N analysis, and 

    * into a ceramic crucible to be dried at 50 dC and ashed at 550 dC for LOI.

3) Using the same pipetter corer, we collected an additional sediment core of the entire sediment dept. bulk core and deposited it into a 20 ml glass scintillation vial to be dried at 50 dC for %C and %N analysis.

4) For the bottles containing leaf discs, each disk was carefully removed with a spatula bent into a hook.  The leaf discs were very gently rinsed over 1 mm sieve with DI, photographed, and haphazardly assigned to different analyses. 

    * Four leaf discs were placed into a 20 ml glass scintillation vial and dried at 50 dC for %C and %N analysis. 

    * Four leaf discs were placed into a 20 ml glass scintillation vial containing 10 ml of methanol for Ergosterol analysis. 

    * Twelve leaf discs were dried at 50 dC in a ceramic crucible and then ashed at 550 dC for LOI.

5) The Ergosterol samples in methanol were capped tightly, wrapped in parafilm and placed in freezer (4 dC).

6) All of the samples used for C:N analysis were homogenized with a mortar and pestle before being analyzed.
