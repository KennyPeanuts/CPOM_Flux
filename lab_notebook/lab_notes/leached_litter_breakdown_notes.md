## Notes

These notes describe the process for collecting the OM samples at the end of the Leached Litter Experiment
The leached litter experiment was broken down to collect samples for Ergosterol, AFDM of sediment and leaves, and C:N ratios of sediment and leaves. First the sediment water interface of all the bottles were photographed in order. We measured the thickness of the oxidized layer using a ruler. Four leaf discs were removed for C:N and placed in plastic weigh boats to be dried at 50 dC. Sixteen dry crucibles were weighed prior to adding leaf discs for ash free dry mass. The remaining number of leaf discs were added to the crucibles. Followed the procedure as described below.

*Lab observations: 
    * Some leaf only crucibles contained sediment that was unable to be rinsed off by DI water. Those include crucible number 24, 20, 6, 11.
    * Dried leaves that were of the sediment leaf treatment were much easier to homogenize than those of leaf only treatment.
    * Julia broke crucible number 1.

### Samples Needed

 Sample Type     | Sample Material                          | Number of Samples
 ----------      | --------------                           | ----------------
 Leaf Ergosterol | 4 leaf disks in 10 ml Methanol           | 8 
 Leaf C:N        | 4 leaf disks dried in scint vial         | 8
 Leaf AFDM       | 12 leaf disks dried in crucible          | 8
 Surf. Sed Ergo  | 1 X 0.8 cm core in 10 ml Methanol        | 8
 Surf. Sed AFDM  | 1 X 0.8 cm core dried in scint vial      | 8
 Surf. Sed C:N   | 1 X 0.8 cm core dried in crucible        | 8
 

### Procedure

1) 5ml of the overlaying water was filtered through GFF for spec scans

2) Drain off water with a siphon without disturbing the sediment water interface

3) Using a plastic pipette with the tip cut off (0.8 cm diameter) and a manual pipetter, we removed 3, 1 cm deep core samples from center of bottle and deposited each into:

* 10 ml of methanol in a 20 ml glass scintillation vial for Ergosterol, 
    
* a 20 ml glass scintillation vial to be dried at 50 dC for %C and %N analysis, and 

* into a ceramic crucible to be dried at 50 dC and ashed at 550 dC for LOI.

4) For the bottles containing leaf discs, each disk was carefully removed with a spatula bent into a hook.  The leaf discs were very gently rinsed over 1 mm sieve with DI, photographed, and haphazardly assigned to different analyses. 

* Leaf discs were placed into weigh boats to be dried at 50 dC.

* Four leaf discs were placed onto weigh boats dried at 50 dC, trasnfered dried leaf discs to 20 ml glass scinillation vial for %C and %N analysis. 

* Four leaf discs were placed into a 20 ml glass scintillation vial containing 10 ml of methanol for Ergosterol analysis. 

* Twelve leaf discs were dried at 50 dC in a ceramic crucible and then ashed at 550 dC for LOI.

5) The Ergosterol samples in methanol were capped tightly, wrapped in parafilm and placed in freezer (4 dC).

6) All of the samples used for C:N analysis were homogenized with a mortar and pestle before being analyzed.

* First sample set of leaf discs were initally homogenized using a mortar and pestle but the samples were overly homogenized and stuck to the mortar and pestle.
 
* The remaining sample sets of leaf discs were homogenized within the scinillation vials and stored at room temperature.
