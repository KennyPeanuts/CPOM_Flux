## Notes

This is the procedure used to sample the BOD bottles during the CPOM Flux experiment

### Procedure

Bottles are incubating with 100 ml of sediment and 185 ml of overlying water

Bottles are in the dark on rocker shakers at room temperature

To sample, for each BOD bottle:

1) Remove 15 ml with the glass syringe and cannula and place in 10 ml serum vial from bottom, allowing overflow to prevent oxygen contamination.

2) Seal vial without air to calibrate volume and then open and fix with Winkler reagents for T-0 SOD measurement.

3) Remove another 15 ml with the glass syringe and cannula and place into 10 ml serum vial from the bottom.

4) Seal the vial without air and place onto dark rocker shaker for ~24 h to measure of water column BOD.

5) Remove 3 ml with glass syringe and cannula, add to sterile vial and preserve with Gluteraldehyde for bacterial abundance - place in fridge.

6) Remove 30 ml with plastic syringe and filter through GFF (25 mm) into 50 ml acid-washed conical centrifuge tube - freeze for nutrient analysis.

7) Remove 5 ml with plastic syringe and filter through same GFF into a 15 ml conical centrifuge tube - place in fridge for spectral absorbance analysis.

8) Carefully add 90 ml of replacement water back into BOD bottle without disturbing the sediments and seal bottle with glass stopper.

9) Incubate BOD bottle in the dark on the rocker-shaker for ~5 h

10) After incubation, remove 15 ml from BOD bottle with glass syringe and cannula and add to 10 ml serum vial from bottom, allowing overflow to prevent oxygen contamination.

11) Seal vial without air to calibrate volume and then open and fix with Winkler reagents for T-1 SOD measurement.

12) Return BOD bottle to dark rocker-shaker uncapped.
