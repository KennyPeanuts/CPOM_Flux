## Description

These are organic matter samples collected from the leached litter experiment to be sent to Matt Waters at Valdosta State for analysis. Full collection details can be found at

Briefly we collected 4 of the 20 leaf discs in the bottles, rinsed them gently with DI-water and dried them at 50 dC in a weigh-boat for several days. The leaf samples were then placed in a 20 ml glass scintillation vial and ground and homogenized in the vial with a metal spatula. Sediment samples were collected by taking a 0.8 cm X 1 cm core from the center of the bottle after the overlying water had been drained off. The core was dried at 50 dC in a 20 ml glass scintillation vial and then ground and homogenized with a metal spatula.

The initial samples were collected from the leaves after they had been leached but prior to placement into the BOD bottles. The initial samples consist of 20 homogenized leaves.

Where BOD # is the ID of the BOD bottle in the experiment, initial 1 and 2 are samples of the leached leaves before being placed in the experiment, L is the treatment with only leaves, LS is the treatment with leaves and sediment, S is the treatment with only sediment, and OM type indicates what type of sample it is leaf or sediment (sed).

## Shipping 

The samples were shipped to:

Dr. Matt Waters, Biology Department, Valdosta State University, 1500 N Patterson St., Valdosta, GA 31698
