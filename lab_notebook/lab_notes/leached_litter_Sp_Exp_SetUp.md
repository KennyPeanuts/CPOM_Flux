## Purpose

These notes document the set up of the leached litter experiment begun in the Winter of 2016

## Field Sediment and Water Collection

### 29 Jan 2016

On 29 Jan 2016 we collected sediments and water from LPP. The lake was frozen and so we slid a raft onto the ice and chopped 2 holes through the ice that were approximately 20 m from the shore toward the middle of the lake. We then took 3 ekman samples from
each hole, taking care not to hit the same spot in the sediments. The ekman samples from each hole were combined into a single basin, so there were 2 basins each with 3 ekman samples in them. The water was about 1 m deep where the ekmans were taken

Back on shore the sediments were passed through 250 um mesh nets to exclude CPOM and macroinvertebrates.

We collected 9 L of water from another hole about 10 m toward the middle of the lake from the ekman holes.  The water from this hole came out clear, so it did not appear that the ekman sampling affected the water collection. The water was about 1.5 m deep where the water was collected and the YSI run.

A YSI sample was collected from another hole adjacent to where the water was collected.

| Parameter |  0 m  | 0.5 m | 1 m   |
| --------- | ----- | ----- | ----  |
| Temp (dC) | 4.69  | 4.73  | 4.95  |
| Cond (uS) | 12.99 | 12.91 | 12.79 |
| perc DO   | 




The bottles were then placed haphazardly on the rocker shakers in the dark with speed = 8 and tilt = 8

## Treatments

The treatment levels were randomly assigned to the bottles
