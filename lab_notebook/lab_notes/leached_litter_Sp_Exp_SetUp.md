## Purpose

These notes document the set up of the leached litter experiment begun in the Winter of 2016

## Field Sediment and Water Collection

### 29 Jan 2016

On 29 Jan 2016 we collected sediments and water from LPP. The lake was frozen and so we slid a raft onto the ice and chopped 2 holes through the ice that were approximately 20 m from the shore toward the middle of the lake. We then took 3 ekman samples from
each hole, taking care not to hit the same spot in the sediments. The ekman samples from each hole were combined into a single basin, so there were 2 basins each with 3 ekman samples in them. The water was about 1 m deep where the ekmans were taken

Back on shore the sediments were passed through 250 um mesh nets to exclude CPOM and macroinvertebrates.

We collected 9 L of water from another hole about 10 m toward the middle of the lake from the ekman holes.  The water from this hole came out clear, so it did not appear that the ekman sampling affected the water collection. The water was about 1.5 m deep where the water was collected and the YSI run.

A YSI sample was collected from another hole adjacent to where the water was collected.

| Parameter |  0 m  | 0.5 m | 1 m   |
| --------- | ----- | ----- | ----  |
| Temp (dC) | 4.69  | 4.73  | 4.95  |
| Cond (uS) | 12.99 | 12.91 | 12.79 |
| perc DO   | 66.7  | 70.4  | 76.1  |
| DO (mg/L) | 8.17  | 8.66  | 9.32  |


### 4 Feb 2016

Water (6 L) was collected from LPP using the dip-collector and stored in the dark at room temperature. The pond at the time of collection was full of runoff from recent rain and the water was rather turbid with some suspended particulates.

### 10 Feb 2016

Water (10 L) was collected from LPP using the dip-collector and placed in the refrigerator

## Lab Procedures

### 3 Feb 2016

Using a ladle the sediment slurry in the buckets was thoroughly mixed and then ladled into a graduated cylinder to add to the BOD bottles.

150 ml of slurry was added to BOD bottles (300 ml) that had been randomly assigned to treatment levels.

The BOD bottles were then filled to the top (approximately 200 ml) with the lake water collected on 29 Jan 2016.

The bottles the placed on the dark and allowed to settle.

The BOD bottle assignments are:

| BOD Number | Treatment Level |
| ---------- | --------------- |
| 1          | Leaf            |
| 2          | Leaf            |
| 3          | No Leaf         |
| 4          | Leaf            |
| 5          | No Leaf         |
| 6          | No Leaf         |
| 7          | Leaf            |
| 8          | Leaf            |
| 9          | No Leaf         |
| 10         | No Leaf         |

### 2 Feb 2016

The overlying water in all of the bottles was replaced with the lake water collected on 29 Jan 2016. The water was sucked off with a syringe down to within a few mm of the sediment-water interface and then water was very carefully added back so as not to disturb the sediments.

| BOD Number | Water Vol Removed (ml) | Water Vol Replaced (ml) |
| ---------  | ---------------------- | ----------------------- |
| 7          | 220                    | 230                     |
| 3          | 250                    | 245                     |
| 4          | 230                    | 245                     |
| 5          | 240                    | 240                     |

| 8          | 235                    | 240                     |
| 6          | 240                    | 235                     |

### 5 Feb 2016

The overlying water in the BOD bottle was partially changed again. About 100 ml of water was removed
