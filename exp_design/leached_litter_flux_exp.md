## Research Questions and Justification

### Background and Goal

The overall goal of this series of studies is to understand the way in which terrestrial leaf litter affects the biogeochemistry of man-made ponds.  

Initial sampling showed that terrestrial litter is abundant in the sediments of the small ponds in the Farmville area - [CPOM Suvey Analysis](https://github.com/KennyPeanuts/CPOM_Density/blob/master/lab_notebook/analysis/CPOM_survey_2013_analysis.md)

In the summer of 2014 KP and KF conducted an experiment that showed that leaf litter elevated SOD initially but the effect appeared to diminish as the experiment progressed - [CPOM Flux Exp SOD Analysis](https://github.com/KennyPeanuts/CPOM_Flux/blob/master/lab_notebook/analysis/CPOM_Flux_SOD_Analysis.md#plots)

We also found that the slope ratio (Sr) of the DOC was greater on day 0 but not on any of the other days of the experiment [CPOM Flux Exp Sr Analysis](https://github.com/KennyPeanuts/CPOM_Flux/blob/master/lab_notebook/analysis/CPOM_Flux_Exp_spec_analysis.md#sr-data)

All of these results suggest that litter does increase the amount of OM mineralization in the sediments but that the effect may only be partially due to the effect of labile leachates
