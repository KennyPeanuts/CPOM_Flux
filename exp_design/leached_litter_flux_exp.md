## Research Questions and Justification

### Background and Goal

The overall goal of this series of studies is to understand the way in which terrestrial leaf litter affects the biogeochemistry of man-made ponds.  

Initial sampling showed that terrestrial litter is abundant in the sediments of the small ponds in the Farmville area - [CPOM Suvey Analysis](https://github.com/KennyPeanuts/CPOM_Density/blob/master/lab_notebook/analysis/CPOM_survey_2013_analysis.md)

In the summer of 2014 KP and KF conducted an experiment that showed that leaf litter elevated SOD initially but the effect appeared to diminish as the experiment progressed - [CPOM Flux Exp SOD Analysis](https://github.com/KennyPeanuts/CPOM_Flux/blob/master/lab_notebook/analysis/CPOM_Flux_SOD_Analysis.md#plots)

We also found that the slope ratio (Sr) of the DOC was greater on day 0 but not on any of the other days of the experiment [CPOM Flux Exp Sr Analysis](https://github.com/KennyPeanuts/CPOM_Flux/blob/master/lab_notebook/analysis/CPOM_Flux_Exp_spec_analysis.md#sr-data)

All of these results suggest that litter does increase the amount of OM mineralization in the sediments but that the effect may only be partially due to the effect of labile leachates.

These results also suggest that the addition of leaf litter may be involved in priming the decomposition of sediment organic matter.

## Research Question

How do leached terrestrial detritus subsidies alter the decomposition of sediment organic matter?

## Objectives and Hypotheses

1. Quantify how leached terrestrial leaf litter alters sediment metabolism.

    * H1 The sediment oxygen demand of sediments plus leached leaf litter will be greater than sediments that do not have leaf litter and leaf litter alone.

## Experimental Design

* Treatment levels:
  
    * leached leaf litter

    * sediment 

    * sediment + leached leaf litter

* Replicates = 4 per level --> total of 12 bottles

* Response

    * change in [O2] (to calculate SOD)
  
    * water BOD

    * absorbance

    * fungal biomass
 
    * LOI sediment OM and leaf litter

## Methods Description

### Bottle Set-up

Sediments will be collected from near the littoral zone of LPP with an Ekman dredge.  The sediments will then be passed through a 250 &mu;m mesh to remove macroinvertebrates and CPOM.  The resultant sediment slurry will then be homogenized and 100 ml of slurry will be added to each bottle and allowed to settle.  Following settling, the overlying water will be siphoned off and replaced with pond water, collected at the same time as the sediments until the overlying water looks clear. Typically this is 2 - 3 replacements.

The leaf litter added to the sediments will come from senecent tulip poplar leaves collected in 2013 and air dried. The leaves will be leached for 4 days in DI water prior to cutting into 10 mm discs.  Each bottle (except the sediment only bottle) will receive 20 leaf discs.

### Bottle Sampling Protocol

#### First Sampling

1) Fill bottles to full volume and cap

2) Remove 15 ml from each bottle and fix for T0 oxygen measurement

3) Remove 15 ml from each bottle and incubate for Water Respiration

4) Remove 5 ml of water from each bottle and filter through GFF for spec scan

5) Replace 35 ml of water in bottle and seal

6) Incubate bottle in the dark for 4 - 6 h 

7) Remove 15 ml from each bottle and fix fo T1 oxygen measurement

8) Return bottles to dark uncovered

#### Typical Sampling

1) Remove 15 ml from each bottle and fix for T0 oxygen measurement

2) Remove 15 ml from each bottle and incubate for Water Respiration

3) Remove 5 ml of water from each bottle and filter through GFF for spec scan

4) Replace 50 ml of water in bottle and seal

5) Incubate bottle in the dark for 4 - 6 h 

6) Remove 15 ml from each bottle and fix fo T1 oxygen measurement

7) Return bottles to dark uncovered

### Experiment Breakdown

* Be sure to measure the water volume of each bottle
